Design Process
This website is for Company who is currently recruiting. Me as a job seeker, what i want to achieve is getting their attention
by looking through my portfolio. I created a simple portfolio website to let the employer view it easily. All my links are right ontop of the starting
page. When finished reading content in each website, user can just click on to the next link to view different content. For displaying content, i chose to
use flexbox to display as it will be more neater. Overall, this website is user-friendly and easy to use for all.

This is the link to the Wireframe of my website : https://xd.adobe.com/view/e81959f2-0cca-4964-8c26-f638d737663a-bd4a/
